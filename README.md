# VRM - Vehicle Rental Manager 
**Vehicle Rental Manager 2025 (VRM)** is an in-house system developed for RoyalRentals as part of the COMP 249 â€“ Object-Oriented Programming II course at Concordia University (Winter 2025).

## ðŸ“˜ Project Context
This project was developed under the constraint of using only Java arrays â€” no ArrayLists, no external databases â€” to showcase a solid understanding of object-oriented principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. 
While Java arrays may not be practical for real-world scalability, this project emphasizes clean design and modularity, making it suitable for future enhancements.
